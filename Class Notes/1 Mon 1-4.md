## Important aspects of a computer program

- Performance
- Size
- Documentations
- Don't add extra features
- Logical organization
- __Readibility__
- __Correcetness__

## Vectors

- Resizeable
- Randomly accessing elements is fast
- Inserting can be slow
- Doubles in size each time when insert exceeds current size

``` c++
vector<int32> myVector;
myVector.data(); // Pointer to first element in myVector
```

## Linked List

- Resizable
- Random accessing is slow
- Inserting is fast

``` c++
template <class T>
class ListNode {
public:
	T value;
	ListNode *prev;
	ListNode *next;
};

class List {
public:
	ListNode *head;
	ListNode *tail;
}

List<int32> myList;
```

- Removing an element takes ```O(C)```

## Big O notation

```O(n)``` means worse case takes ```n``` operations to complete an algorithm.

When ```vector<int>myVector(1);``` resizes, it increases in size as: ```1, 2, 4, 8, 16... n^2```. The insertion takes ```O(log(n))``` operations.

|  n  |  # copies  |  Sum (2^n)-1  | (2^n)+1 |
|:---:|:----------:|:-------------:|:-------:|
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 |
| 2 | 4 | 7 | 5 |
| 3 | 8 | 15 | 9 |
| 4 | 16 | 31 | 17 |
| 5 | 32 | 63 | 33 |
| 6 | 64 | 127 | 65 |

However when ```push_back``` ```n``` times, O(n) "copies" will be performed. Since ```O(n)``` is greater than ```O(log(n))``` therefore, ```vector::push_back``` takes ```O(n)``` in worse case.

Amortized - Repeat the algorithms lots of times. "large enough that making it larger will not change the conclusion"

```vector::push_back``` takes ```O(1)``` since no more resizes and copies shall be made when amortized.
