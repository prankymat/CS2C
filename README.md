# C++ Data structure and algorithms

Data structure and algorithms written in C++.

## How to use this repository
- Do not commit unfinished codes.
- Create a branch per assignment and commit works on it.
- Please use this repo responsibaly. Code may be buggy. If you have better solutions, feel free to fork and crate a pull request!
- Happy hacking!

## How to compile and run
Simply ```cd``` into the project's directory and run ```make run``` to run.

```bash
cd "Assignment 1/HelloWorld"
make run     # Prints "hello world"
make clean   # Removes main.o
```

```main.cpp``` in every assignments' directory contains some test cases for the data structure, please add your own tests cases as needed.

## List of assignments
- [Assignment 1: Hello World](Assignment 1/HelloWorld)
	- Prints "hello world" on screen as a simple test.
- [Assignment 2: Ternary Search](Assignment 2/TernarySearch)
